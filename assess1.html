    <h2>What is CSS ?</h2>
    <ol type="1">
       <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.</li><br>
       <li>CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media.</li><br>
       <li><b><del style="background-color: white;">CSS is not nessesary</del> CSS saves a lot of work.</b> It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once. </li><br>
       <li><u><i>External stylesheets are stored in CSS files.</i></u></li><br>
    </ol>
    <h2>CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Inline-by using the style attribute inside HTML elements1.</li>
        <li>Internal- by using a style element in the head section.</li>
        <li>External- by using a link element to link to an external CSS file.</li>
        <li>The most comman way to add CSS. is to keep the styles in external CSS files. However, <b> in this tutorial we will use inline and internal styles,</b> because this is easier to demonstrate, and easier for you to try it yourself. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>When comparing CSS class vs ID, the difference is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements. ID, on the other hand, applies a style to one unique element. ID is also special in that you can use a special URL to link directly to an elements and it's used by Javascript.</p>
    <p>In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements on a web page. Once an element has been targeted, a style or set of styles can be applied to the element.</p>
    <p>There is a wide range of selectors available. Two of the most commonly used are class and ID. Both are used to target elements to which a style should be applied.</p>
